Well I had a wild hair to create a solver for the game Wordle that is kinda blowing up right now (https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) It looked like Selenium was my best option to interact with elements, but I'm struggling to get any results. I have two things I'm trying to do.
1. Interact with game keyboard. I found it in the console by going body -> game-app -> #shadow-root -> game-theme manager -> game -> game-keyboard -> #shadow-root -> div id="keyboad" -> 3 rows of buttons. I tried using driver.find_element(By.XPATH, 'button') with a lot of different attempts in place of 'button', but no elements are being found. Is there better way to go about navigating this? I'm not sure if the #shadow-root is an issue, I'm not familiar with that element.

2. Reading the results of entries. Honestly help with the first part is probably enough to get me started, but is there a way to search for a <game-tile> element?

Any links to good tutorials would also be great!
